This repository provides the reference implementation for the paper:

"Synergistic Approaches to Real-Time Video Compression: Integrating
Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and Quantum Computing in Surgical
Telemedicine"

The code implements:
- Method A: RL-Dominated Hybrid Framework
- Method B: Fully Hybrid Co-Optimization Framework

Quantum modules are hardware-agnostic and support simulation or
integration with D-Wave / IBM Quantum backends.
